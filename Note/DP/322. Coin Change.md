# 322. Coin Change

<https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change/>

## Summary

### DP table

dp[i] represents the minimum number of coins required to make up number i. Initialize dp[0] = 0, which means to make up 0, 0 coin is required. Initialize rest elements as k + 1, where k is the given amount, because to make up k, at most k coins are needed. k+1 means a given amount has not beed processed.

### State transition

Given a list of available coins {c1, c2, c3, ..., cn}, dp[i] is depend on dp[i-c1], dp[i-c2], ..., dp[i-cn]. i.e.

dp[i] = min(dp[i-cj]+1), cj \in {c1, c2, c3, ..., cn}

For example, we have coin {1, 2, 5}, and to make up 3, dp[3] is dependent on dp[3-1] and dp[3-2], to make up 6, dp[6] is dependent on dp[6-1], dp[6-2] and dp[6-5]. With one more coin, dp[3-1] coins can make up dp[3], similarly, with one more coin, dp[6-2] coins can make up dp[6].

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int coinChange(vector<int>& coins, int amount) {

        vector<int> dp(amount+1, amount+1);

        // to make up dp[0], 0 coins are needed.
        dp[0] = 0;

        // for every value less or equal to amount
        for(int val = 0; val <= amount; val++)
        {
            // loop over all available coins
            for(int i = 0; i < coins.size(); i++)
            {
                int coin = coins[i];

                // dp[val] is dependent on dp[val-coin]
                // If the coin is greater than val, it cannot used to make up val, so skip it
                int rest = val - coin;
                if (rest < 0)
                    continue;

                dp[val] = min(dp[val], dp[rest]+1);
            }
        }

        return dp[amount] == amount+1 ? -1 : dp[amount];
    }
};
```
